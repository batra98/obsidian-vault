#### Application Requirements
- [[#Statement of Interest | Personal Statement]]
- Three letters of support from faculty and/or employers.
	- A minimum of **three** references are required for application to graduate programs at UBC. References should be requested from individuals who are prepared to provide a report on your academic ability and qualifications. 
	- In the online application system, applicants are asked to provide an email address for each referee. (Please note, that we are unable to accept e-mails from Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail, MSN or other free e-mail accounts for referees.) A unique link will be emailed to each referee, allowing them to log in to a secure site and submit an online reference or upload a reference document as an attachment.
	- We also accept references via [Interfolio](https://www.interfolio.com/), a U.S. based electronic reference service. Interfolio references should be directed to [graduate.sas@ubc.ca](mailto:graduate.sas@ubc.ca).

	The application system allows you to indicate whether a reference is academic or professional.

	- The academic reference form is used in situations where the referee is someone who you have interacted with in an academic setting (e.g. referee was the professor of a course in which you were enrolled).
	- The professional reference form is used in situations where the reference is someone who you have interacted with in a professional setting (e.g. referee was your supervisor at work).

- [[#Transcripts]]

### Statement of Interest
Many programs require a [statement of interest](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/application-admission/statement-interest), sometimes called a "statement of intent", "description of research interests" or something similar.

### Transcripts
- All applicants have to submit transcripts from all past post-secondary study. [Document submission requirements](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/application-admission/transcripts-academic-documents) depend on whether your institution of study is within Canada or outside of Canada.
- Applicants must obtain an official transcript for every post-secondary institution they have attended (other than UBC).

- Each transcript must be scanned as an individual .pdf file and uploaded to the application system as indicated.
- Scan both sides of the transcript and/or degree certificate where there is information, notations, or stamps from the issuing institution.
- Please refer to any directions provided by the selected graduate program on naming scanned document files. Otherwise, files should be named: "Applicant Full Name-Document Description.extension"

	Examples:  
	Peng Zhang-Peking University Transcript.pdf  
	Peng Zhang-Peking University Transcript English Translation.pdf  
	Peng Zhang-CV.pdf  
	Peng Zhang-Journal of Neurosciences Paper.pdf

- Each transcript must be uploaded as a single file (rather than a separate file for each page).
- If you have documents that are issued in a language other than English, then, in addition to uploading digital copies of the documents in their original language, you must also upload a certified literal English translation of your transcripts from your home university's translation service or a certified English translator.
- The online application system provides additional, detailed directions on scanning and uploading of academic documentation.
