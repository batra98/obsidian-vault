#### Important FAQ

#### Defer
Deferral requests will be considered if you have experienced unexpected circumstances that will prevent you from applying for, or enrolling in, the semester which you originally intended.  Please read the following carefully:

- You may submit a request to defer your application for a future semester within one year of your original application semester (Example: If you were admitted to Fall 2022, you could defer your admission to Spring 2023 or Fall 2023)
- Admission is not guaranteed and deferred applications are reviewed along with all other applications for that term
- You do not need to submit a new application or pay the application fee again. You will need to submit any information that has changed since your original application, including updated/final transcripts, valid and official test scores, and/or financial documents
- You can only defer to semesters for which your program has a start term (i.e. if a program does not have a spring start, you cannot defer to spring. You would need to defer to the following fall)
- All updated application materials need to be received by the application deadline for the new semester to which you are applying
- If you already submitted your intent to enroll and commitment deposit, and your request to defer is approved, the $500.00 commitment deposit will automatically be applied to the new term if readmitted
