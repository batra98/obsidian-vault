	- Scores must be sent to the university by the testing agency. The Educational Testing Service (ETS) institution code for the TOEFL is 6882. It is not necessary to use a department code. To fulfill the requirement with scores from the IELTS, please use the IELTS electronic score delivery service to send your scores to the “University of Texas at Austin” account.
- **GRE Requirements**
	- **An official report of Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores (optional for Fall 2024).** Please request that ETS send official test scores to UT-Austin. (UT-Austin code 6882 – you do not need a departmental code).



#### Application Requirements

### Please use [this checklist](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/images/admissions_checklist_2023.pdf) to ensure that you are submitting all the materials necessary. Note: For application to the UT Computer Science graduate program, you are required to submit materials via both the ApplyTexas and the CS Department Supplement applications.

- [[#What to write in SOP.|Statement of Purpose]]
- [[#Resume/CV]]
- Three (3) letters of reference: You must supply your references’ names and email addresses to the CS Department Supplement [this information is not downloaded from ApplyTexas]. After you provide their contact information, emails will be sent to your references with instructions on how to upload their letters. Letters should emphasize research experience and academic achievements, particularly in computer science. Your references should submit their letters by December 20 (17:00 CST) for full consideration.
- Transcripts





#### What to write in SOP.

Approximately 2 pages describing your reasons for pursuing graduate study and academic and professional interests and goals. This may include events/experiences that prepared you for CS graduate study and how your interests complement the department's faculty and research.

This document should explain your rationale for obtaining a graduate degree in Computer Science -- your research interests, what you bring to the program, and how you hope to use the degree. This is not a "life story", but be sure to cover any aspects of your application/background that might need additional explanation. Remember that readers of your statement are CS researchers, but not necessarily in your area!


#### Resume/CV
- Your CV must contain a full and continuous history (no biographical gaps) of your education and work experiences until present. Start with high school up to the point your application is submitted (tabular resume). Your academic history in particular should be as detailed as possible and contain all academic degrees, with most recently earned degrees or degrees still in process listed first. Please do not leave gaps in your CV, even if you were not enrolled at a school or university nor gainfully employed for a certain period of time, i.e. because of extended vacation or hiatus, as we are interested in the entire history of your intellectual and personal development. Please write the CV in the language of instruction of the Master's degree programme you are applying to.


The main criteria used to evaluate applicants for graduate study in CS are grades, test scores, computer science background, letters of reference, and a statement of purpose. We encourage applicants to provide a resume and publications (if any). Applications are evaluated holistically, and admissions decisions are made based on the pool of applicants for a given year.

No one factor will affect admission, but a strong applicant to our program might have:  
GRE-Q 166 or more and GRE-V 160 or more;  
GPA 3.5 or more from a good university;   
Mostly A's in Math and upper CS courses such as Operating Systems, Compilers, Networks, Algorithms, AI, Architecture;   
Internship at a prestigious lab, interesting research projects, paper(s);  
Strong letters, especially from research supervisor or professors.

While not required, a previous CS bachelor’s degree is strongly recommended since admission is very competitive. Successful applicants usually have an undergraduate degree in CS or a closely related area such as Electrical and Computer Engineering. Applicants admitted to the Texas Computer Science graduate program usually have shown their skills in CS by achieving a better than average GPA in their CS courses. For the application, you will be asked to provide transcripts. Any additional experience may be included in your statement of purpose or CV. Use of computers at work or some experience programming are not considered to be equivalent to a CS degree and courses.



### LORS

_Who should I pick as my recommenders? Can I have professional references?_

Three letters of reference are required, but you may provide up to 5 references. Professional references are accepted. Your letter-writers should be able to speak to your CS abilities and should emphasize research experience and academic achievements, particularly in computer science.

_Will letter writers receive a duplicate request from ApplyTexas?_

You may submit your recommenders’ contact information to both sites - the information submitted to the ApplyTexas site will be collected for the University’s records, however your recommenders are only contacted via the information you provided to the CS supplement site. They will not receive a duplicate request from ApplyTexas.

_How do I check the status of my letters? My letter writers haven’t received requests yet._

Recommenders must upload their letters to an online portal; submission instructions will be emailed to your recommenders after you provide their contact information to the CS Department Supplement. An initial email and a reminder are sent automatically. Some email systems filter our email requests as spam/junk. Please ask your letter writers to set any spam/junk filters to receive email from **[csadmis@cs.utexas.edu](mailto:csadmis@cs.utexas.edu)**. 

You may view the status of your letters or queue a new request to be sent by logging in at **[here](http://apply.cs.utexas.edu/grad)** and clicking “REVIEW MY INFO"

Our system sends out the letter requests once a day in an overnight batch - “Request Pending” means that the letter request will be sent out in the next batch. “We asked for a letter” means that a letter request was emailed to the recommender. Once your recommender has submitted their letter, you will see it indicated under their name that the letter has been received.

Your CS supplement does not need to be “submitted” in order for your recommenders to be contacted, and you may submit your application before all of your recommendations have arrived.

_How do I update my list of recommenders?_

You may update your recommenders by logging in at **[http://apply.cs.utexas.edu/grad](http://apply.cs.utexas.edu/grad)**. Updates cannot be made to the ApplyTexas application, but this will not cause any issues. We only use the information you provide to the CS Department Supplement to contact your recommenders.

When updating your recommenders, please ***remove*** the recommender you no longer wish contacted and then add the new recommender. Up to five letters of recommendation are permitted.

_Can my recommenders submit letters through Interfolio?_

We do not accept materials through Interfolio. Recommenders must upload their letters to an online portal; submission instructions will be emailed to them at the address you provide in your application. 

_When are letters due? Will you still consider my application if a letter of recommendation is late or missing? Will you review late letters?_

Letters of recommendation should be received by **December 20 (17:00 CST)** for full consideration, however we will continue to accept letters throughout the evaluation process. Your application will still be considered with late or missing letters of recommendation. Late information won't be included in our initial ranking process but will be available to our review committee during their deliberations. If the admissions committee has already reviewed your application before you make changes, it is not guaranteed that your application will be reviewed again.
