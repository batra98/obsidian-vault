The application will not be processed if EPFL does not receive at least two reference letters.

During the application process, you will be requested to give your referees’ contact details. Validating your electronic application will generate a personal e-mail to your referees, requesting them to fill in the recommendation form.

**Be aware** that the reference letters must be uploaded to the system. The deadline for receiving the letters is one week after the application deadline.
