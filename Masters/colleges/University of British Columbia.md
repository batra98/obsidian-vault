	- The professional reference form is used in situations where the reference is someone who you have interacted with in a professional setting (e.g. referee was your supervisor at work).

#### Supervision
Students in research-based programs usually require a faculty member to function as their thesis supervisor. Please follow the instructions provided by each program whether applicants should contact faculty members.

##### INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING THESIS SUPERVISOR CONTACT FOR MASTER OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (MSC)

Applicants should browse faculty profiles and indicate in their application who they are interested in working with. However, it is not necessary for applicants to contact faculty members prior to their application.

### Statement of Interest



You are required to upload the statement of intent (PDF). The filename must contain the word "Intent" (eg Statement_Intent.pdf). There are 3 parts to your Statement of Intent.

#### Part 1: Describe your research interests (Please keep Part 1 within 2 pages; mandatory)

Part 1 of your statement of intent is your opportunity to tell us about you and your research interests.  It should be brief, 1 or at most 2 pages (not limited to # of words on each page), which describe:

1.  The research area(s) you wish to pursue in graduate school      
2.  Your future academic and career plans     
3.  Those aspects of your previous education, training and work experience that prepared you for graduate school  
     and future career

As each faculty member can only supervise a limited number of graduate students, not all applicants in a given research area will be accepted into the program.

#### Part 2: Publication (no word or page limit; only if applicable)

Beginning with your most recent, list the following:

1.  Papers published or accepted in refereed journals
2.  Papers submitted to refereed journals
3.  Other refereed contributions (e.g. technical reports, conference presentations, posters, etc.)
4.  Patents and copyrights (e.g. software, but not publication copyrights) submitted or awarded

Please indicate the full authorship as it appears/will appear in the original publication, year, title, publication name and volume, and number of pages. DO NOT send your article or thesis.

#### Part 3: Summary of Honours, Scholarships, Fellowships, and Awards (no word or page limit; only if applicable)

Beginning with the most recent, give the name of each award that you received, its value (if applicable), the period held or given, the scope of the award (i.e. whether it is institutional, provincial, national, or international) and a brief (one to two sentence) description. DO NOT send photocopies of your scholarship certificates.

Many programs require a [statement of interest](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/application-admission/statement-interest), sometimes called a "statement of intent", "description of research interests" or something similar.

### Transcripts
- All applicants have to submit transcripts from all past post-secondary study. [Document submission requirements](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/application-admission/transcripts-academic-documents) depend on whether your institution of study is within Canada or outside of Canada.
- Applicants must obtain an official transcript for every post-secondary institution they have attended (other than UBC).

- Each transcript must be scanned as an individual .pdf file and uploaded to the application system as indicated.
- Scan both sides of the transcript and/or degree certificate where there is information, notations, or stamps from the issuing institution.
- Please refer to any directions provided by the selected graduate program on naming scanned document files. Otherwise, files should be named: "Applicant Full Name-Document Description.extension"

	Examples:  
	Peng Zhang-Peking University Transcript.pdf  
	Peng Zhang-Peking University Transcript English Translation.pdf  
	Peng Zhang-CV.pdf  
	Peng Zhang-Journal of Neurosciences Paper.pdf

- Each transcript must be uploaded as a single file (rather than a separate file for each page).
- If you have documents that are issued in a language other than English, then, in addition to uploading digital copies of the documents in their original language, you must also upload a certified literal English translation of your transcripts from your home university's translation service or a certified English translator.
- The online application system provides additional, detailed directions on scanning and uploading of academic documentation.
