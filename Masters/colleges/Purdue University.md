#### What to write in SOP.

**There is no word limit** but it is in your best interest to be concise.

**We prefer that you write a comment or short paragraph under each of the following headings and upload into the electronic application system:**

- Applicant's Name:
- Long Term Degree Objective:
- Research Experience:
- Publications:
- Future Research Interests:
- Other Comments:

There is no specific word limit for the Statement of Purpose for the CS department but it is best to keep it concise and follow the outline given here: [https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/admission/SoP.html](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/admission/SoP.html). We recommend staying within 300-500 words, but that is not a hard requirement.

#### Letter of Recommendations
At least three letters of recommendation must be submitted electronically as part of your **[Electronic Graduate School application](https://gradapply.purdue.edu/apply/)** before the **[application deadline](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/admission/steps.html).**

We suggest submitting the online application after all recommenders submitted their letters.

We urge that all your letters be from academic or professional references as recent as possible and from people who can comment on your recent professional accomplishments and your qualifications for graduate study in Computer Science.

If you have done research, we expect a recommendation from your supervisor.

Please ask the recommenders to include a very brief description of their qualifications for writing the letter.

**For M.S. applicants:** We recommend that you provide letters of reference from professors who have taught you in your junior and senior years.

**For Ph.D. applicants:** If you have an M.S. degree, letters from professors who have served on your M.S. committee are particularly helpful.

If you have left or are leaving an advanced degree program at another institution before receiving the degree, we expect at least one letter of recommendation from that institution. That letter should deal with the reasons for your departure.

Not waiving your right to review a letter of recommendation tends to diminish the value of the letter.


#### Personal History Document
**The Personal History Statement** helps reviewers learn more about you as a whole person and as a potential graduate student. This may include relevant details on community service, leadership roles, participation in diverse teams, and significant barriers that you overcame to attend graduate school.

Required of all degree-seeking applicants:

1.      Describe how your background and life experiences contribute to your ability to be both persistent and resourceful in graduate school.

2.     Describe how your life experiences have prepared you to contribute to an academic community where scholars with diverse research interests, abilities, backgrounds, and experiences are supported, respected, and valued.

Optional:

3.      Please address concerns that you may have that your academic record does not reflect your true capabilities and discuss mitigating factors that have affected your academic record. Reviewers will be interested in understanding your accomplishments relative to your opportunities.

The Academic Statement of Purpose and the Personal History Statement are two of the most important documents in your graduate school application. The documents should be concise, clear, and free of spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. You should have others review your document for content, organization, and to ensure that there are no errors. Information in the Personal History Statement should complement but not duplicate information in the Academic Statement of Purpose.
