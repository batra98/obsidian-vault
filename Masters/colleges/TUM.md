## Requirements

If you did not obtain your Bachelor's degree in a country within the EU/EEA, you have to upload a **preliminary documentation from uni-assist (VPD)**. In order to get the VPD, you must send the required documents (some as notarized copies!) to uni-assist via post! Uni-assist still needs the documents in paper. As the issuance of the VPD can take up to 4 weeks, we highly recommend sending the necessary documents to uni-assist very early. More information on [Preliminary Documentation (VPD) by uni-assist](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/application/application-info-portal/uni-assist "Preliminary Documentation (VPD) by uni-assist").

#### Important FAQ
https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/pg/mcs/faq/

**_Can I apply for more than one specialisation for MComp via the online Graduate Admission System?_**_  
**Ans:** Yes, you can. However, the system only allows you to select one specialisation, that is, your first preference. If you want to apply for your second and/or third specialisation preference(s), you will need to clearly indicate your additional preference(s) in your **“Personal Statement”**. The application fee is still S$100 (before prevailing GST) for such case._
