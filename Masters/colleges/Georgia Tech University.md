### Before You Apply
- Before you begin your graduate application to Georgia Tech, please make sure to read the [application instructions](https://grad.gatech.edu/admissions/application-instructions) carefully. **Although you will be able to add some materials after you have submitted your application, you will not be able to make revisions once it has been submitted.**


### Recommendations

Recommenders will be asked to provide information regarding:

- Acquaintance with the Applicant

- Upload Recommendation Letter

### What to write in SOP.

The statement of purpose allows you to highlight areas of your background or interests that may not be clear in other areas of your application. Therefore, it is very important to write a clear and concise statement that expresses your interest in the program, and what you hope to gain from, or bring to, the program of study. You may address special features of the program that made it the right fit for you, or you may address specific topics that you are interested in studying. You may wish to address aspects of your personal, academic, and work-related experiences that would make effective contributions to the program or would showcase your knowledge and interest in your chosen area of study. This statement should be concise, outline a plan for graduate studies, and indicate why Georgia Tech is the right graduate program to meet this plan. It should include what you plan to accomplish with our MSCS degree, and what we should remember about you when considering your application.


### View my Recommendation

Since a recommender will see your decision to waive/not waive when they access the form, the response to the waiver question can influence a recommender's recommendation or decision to even submit one. 

- If you waived your right to review, you cannot change your decision after the recommender has received the recommendation notification, and you will not be provided a copy of the recommendation.   
- If you do not waive your right to review, you will receive a copy of the letter(s) 30 days after the start of the semester to which you applied if you submitted and paid the application. You can change your decision from "do not waive" to "waive" by contacting the Office of Graduate Education staff to update your response. Please click on the "I have a question" button at the bottom of this page to submit a request. 
- Once a recommendation is submitted by the recommender, no changes can be made to the decision to waive or not waive.

### Track Application

Once you have submitted your application, you can track the status via your [Application Status Portal](https://gradapp.gatech.edu/apply/status) or email. The portal is also where you will be able to upload application materials, view the application checklist and your admission decision, access helpful links, and more.

If additional materials are needed for your application, the Office of Graduate Education will let you know via email or the Application Status Portal.

**You will not receive a confirmation when specific materials have been received, but the material will be marked as “Received” in the application checklist.** Please note that that the Office of Graduate Education processes a high volume of application materials, and you may experience a long wait time. Your patience is appreciated during this time.

#### Application Fee Waiver

**_To apply for an application fee waiver, please send a copy of your resume or transcript to [inquire@mse.gatech.edu](mailto:inquire@mse.gatech.edu). In the message, please mention your citizenship and the aspect of your identity that is underrepresented (such as your racial/ethnic group). Requesting a fee waiver will have no bearing on admission decisions.**
