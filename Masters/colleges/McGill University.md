#### Application Requirements
- [[#Statement of Interest | Personal Statement]]
- 2 letters of support from faculty and/or employers.
	- - Two (2) letters of recommendation are required. Reference letters must be uploaded directly by the referee.
	- Especially for applicants to the PhD and the M.Sc. thesis programs, we greatly prefer receiving academic references, that is, letters supplied by university professors or course instructors. If you had a supervisor for your university studies or for a thesis, we would like one of the letters to be supplied by this person (this is especially important for Ph.D. applicants). If you graduated from university several years ago, we realize that it may be difficult to obtain academic references. In this case, you may substitute letters from your employers or co-workers. (We give academic references much more weight when assessing an application).
	- You must identify on the application form two referees, who are familiar with your work, and who are willing to write the letters of recommendation. You must provide a valid institutional e-mail address for each referee.
	- McGill University will send an email to each referee you identify on the application form, asking for a reference in support of your application to be admitted.  If no response is received, a reminder message will be sent every two weeks. In rare cases a referee may decline the request; you will be advised by email if your selected referee declines, and you will be asked to provide an alternate. Referees will be invited to login to a secure portion of the McGill website where they can upload the letter(s) of reference.  
	- Letters must meet the following conditions:
	    - The program the student has applied to must be clearly indicated and the letter should include information that would aid an admissions committee in making an informed decision.
	    - Letters must be dated and not be more than 12 months old.
	    - The referee must indicate his/her position and full contact information at the institution.
- [[#Transcripts]]
- CV - Both Masters and Ph.D. applicants should include a copy of their CV.

### Statement of Interest

### What should I include in my personal statement?

For the personal statement, it should include your research interests, and mention which professors you are interested in working with. You can also briefly describe proposed research, any special circumstances or special project you have work on in the past, or any other achievements. It should not exceed one page.


- Ph.D. applicants must (and M.Sc. Thesis applicants are strongly encouraged to) provide a statement outlining the objective of their graduate program, i.e., preferred areas of study, potential research interests and proposed supervisors.
- M.Sc. Non-Thesis applicants have to provide a 1-page statement covering the following aspects:
    - Describe why you are interested in this applied program here at McGill and how it aligns with your career goals.
    - Describe the most significant software project you have completed by addressing the following questions. In which context was the project conducted (course work, industrial work, other)? What were the key objectives of the project? What were the key technologies that you used? Was the software published as open source? Did you collaborate with others and if yes, what role did they play. Has the software be used by others?
    - Describe any other achievements that might be relevant. In particular, if you do not have an undergraduate degree in core Computer Science, feel free to indicate any other experience you have that might be valuable for this program.
    - You might also inform us about team work that you conducted and experience in leadership roles.
    - Please feel free to also indicate any special circumstances that might have delayed your studies or otherwise affected you.

For the Ph.D. program and the M.Sc. thesis program, the School requires a list of at least 3 proposed supervisors that you would like to work with in order to process your application.

### Transcripts
- A record of study is required from each university-level institution you have attended.
- Transcripts in languages other than English or French must be accompanied by an English or French translation provided by the institution issuing the transcript, or by a certified translator. A copy in the original language is also required; an English or French translation alone is not sufficient.
- An unofficial copy of your complete university-level academic record to date must be uploaded through your applicant page.
- If the transcript does not indicate that a degree has been conferred, a copy of the degree certificate (diploma) will also need to be uploaded.
- If you receive an offer of admission you will be required to make arrangements for an official copy of each transcript to be sent to McGill University.
